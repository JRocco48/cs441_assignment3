In Galactic Defense, it is your job to defend.. the galactic.. 
Shoot the galaxy's enemies with your fast-firing twin laser cannons! 
But be careful, their ships are strong and can only be destroyed if hit on the weak spot. 

This game is a very generic space shooter with a moving background, but was very fun to create. 
The artwork was done by my friend Vinny Desimone.
Enjoy 8^)
